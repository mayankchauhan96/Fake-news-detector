# Use Case:
As the SARS-CoV-2 virus – more popularly known as COVID-19 – has spread around the globe, conspiracy theories and rumours have also gone viral on social media platforms and other outlets.
Or we can rather state them as "infodemics", these can result in a very hazardous outcome if someone/community is believing them (The news which you all must have heard about the loss of lives caused by alcohol consumption by some citizens of Italy who were even found negative after their test).

# How this works?
Basically we building awhatsapp app which will help in getting client's query and response back the correct information.
In initial stage we have to volunteer some individuals which will mark the relevant flag against that news/post in front end web app. Later we are planning to automatically verify the media source with the help of ML models. This will also work for all other news topics as well.

##There are basically following technologies to be used here:
---
Framework used : vue.js,
Backend process: Flask,
Database: firebase,
ML model (not started till now),
Whatsapp business api
